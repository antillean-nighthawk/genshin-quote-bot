Discord bot that says lines of characters from Genshin Impact

This is my first time making a Discord bot, I hope you enjoy.

Important!
Your Discord API token is included in a .env file located in the same directory as the project for the bot to work.
All the .env file needs to have is TOKEN = {insert api token here}

How to use the bot:
Bot prefix is $
Syntax is $say {character name} {topic}
For example, $say hutao hello
If topic is not specified it defaults to hello
Look at the code to see what characters and topics there are, I will add a help command in the future.

All characters are from the game Genshin Impact and credit goes to Mihoyo
~~please dont sue me Mihoyo~~

Progress Notes:
12/19/2021
I just started making this bot so it only has Hu Tao's lines so far.
I plan to add more characters and additional languages.
