  "Really? So in all this time, no new Electro Visions have appeared in the outside world? Well, what I can say on this topic is subject to certain constraints, but... it is not by my will that Visions are granted or denied. The key is people's desire, and... well, there's another side to it too.",

    "Kamisato... One of the most distinguished clans in all of Inazuma. Despite Ayato's trickery in regard to the Tri-Commission's affairs, he is nevertheless a loyal subject. His past misdeeds shall be excused.",
    "A loyal and righteous subject, and an accomplished warrior. She is worthy to be called a hero. With an heir of such great promise, the future prosperity of the Kujou Clan is assured.",
    "Indeed. It was I who slew Orobaxi. But I also allowed the people of Sangonomiya to continue worshiping it as the Watatsumi Omikami, so that it might enjoy their offerings. Now, Sangonomiya has destroyed the local Narukami Shrine and rebels against the Shogunate. As the Divine Priestess representing the Watatsumi Omikami, she must be held accountable.",
    "Who?",
    "Ah, that girl... She used to be the kind of person who could easily be swayed with some Fried Tofu. It's a relief to see how shrewd and resourceful she's now become. Still, I have to admit that I was a little upset to become the target of her scheming myself. I know it was for my own good, but I'm afraid she will mock me next time we meet... Perhaps I should take the initiative and strike her first? Hmm, she'll dodge it anyway.",
    "Kamisato... One of the most distinguished clans in all of Inazuma. Eh? That's exactly what the Shogun said? Well, A—Ayaka's also well-versed in the art of the sword.",
    "I can't deny that I am somewhat culpable in the events that led to him being almost stripped of his Vision, but I rather think the Shogun should be the one to extend a formal apology to him... Okay, fine. I'll give it some more thought.",
    "He came about as a byproduct of creating the Shogun. Perhaps it's because I feel like I owe him something, but I do not wish to assert control over him.",
    "I had an opportunity to feast with him once, back when I was just a kagemusha attending a gathering of the gods. So he's made his choice. Be that as it may, I don't believe his story is anywhere near finished yet.",
    "That's the name the Anemo Archon takes these days, is it? Truth be told, from the very first moment I met him, I could somehow sense that we were not going to get along. Also, he sure can drink a lot.",
    "Who? Ah, the firework maker. A manufacturer of fleeting illusions, enamored with the realm of fantasy and imagination, but a subject of mine nonetheless. Hmm? Fireworks were released on Tenryou Commission property? By whom... her?"

    "The initial stage of my journey, or Shoden, involves learning the nine-way sword slash and the foundations of the art of the polearm. There is no great variation from other traditions at this point. Or rather, it is the other traditions that do not differ from mine.",
    "At the intermediate stage of my journey, or Chuden, the art of the sword focuses on the study of various stances and transitions. The art of the polearm — slashes and backslashes.",
    "The final stage of my journey, or Kaiden, is the study of the most profound techniques. Unavoidably, these draw heavily on elemental power, rendering them beyond the capabilities of most mortals. Most practitioners of other traditions are unable to ever reach this level."
