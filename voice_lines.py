Until then, there's no room for complacency!",

It makes me think that... maybe, there is only one person I know who is truly able to get close to me...",

We were harassed by the Fatui, we lost many of our people, and we received a great deal of criticism.

Brother has worked tirelessly to reverse the trend since he assumed leadership, but although our clan's position is now restored and the Yashiro Commission is unified once more, we still rely on Brother to make the decisions on all matters of any importance.",
    "The art of blade forging taught by the Shogun varies based on astrology, application, materials used, the furnace conditions, individual personalities, and elemental changes. These differences between smiths is what gave rise to the Raiden Gokaden. Swordsmiths capable of forging renowned blades are seen as spiritual personnel with sacred abilities, and as such they should be managed by the Yashiro Commission, which oversees all cultural, artistic, and ceremonial affairs. So naturally, the swordsmith's betrayal is the fault of ineffectual management by the Kamisato Clan.",
